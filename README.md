# Is it payday?

I'm a little obsessed with creating simple applications in Javascript. In wanting to pratice using Javascript in functional ways, I created this webpage which answers the question of it is payday or not. 

## But wait...
This website is purposely (at least, for now) simple. Currently payday is assumed to be twice a month, on the 15th and 30th.

## Parking lot (possible enhancements)

- [] Input for defining pay dates
- [] Conditional statement for if payday falls on a weekend or holday
- [] Conditional for if a month has less than 31 days
- [x] Output was today's date is
- [] Output when the date paydate is (or how many days away it is)
- [] Error messages. Cannot find date, invalid date format, etc
